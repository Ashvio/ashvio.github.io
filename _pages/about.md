As an industry ML/AI expert, I have focused my craft on designing and implement fully-featured ML pipelines for abuse prevention in user-generated content. With over four years of experience in data science and software engineering, I have developed a strong expertise in deep learning, algorithms, and artificial intelligence.. I also have expertise in Reinforcement Learning, data pipelines, and technical and policy writing.

 I'm especially passionate about applying ML in ways that benefit groups that have historically been underserved by technology. My mission is to create positive and engaging experiences for millions of people around the world through thoughtful and responsible applications of AI. I have successfully trained and deployed models at several companies with large userbases that currently help prevent abuse across millions of interactions every day.

I have had a strong interest in AI and ML for 8 years, ever since I took a Robotics class as a freshman in college. Since then, I took several Data Science/Statistics classes, worked on several research projects in collaboration with professors, and even published a research paper as my Honors Thesis at UT Austin. Today, outside of work, I keep close tabs on trends and changes in ML as the field rapidly evolves.

Today, I am applying for PhD programs in Computer Science with a focus on AI/ML. I am especially interested in research that can help make AI more accessible and equitable for all people, and I am excited to work with researchers who share this vision.

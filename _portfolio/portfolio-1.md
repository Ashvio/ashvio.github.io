This project was my Turing Honors thesis project in 2019, and was capable of predicting 2016 Presidential election results and polling using Reddit data.  The paper is available [here](https://ashvio.github.io/files/Turing_Honors_Thesis.pdf). I also wrote a more informal blog post in 2017 available [here](https://medium.com/melting-glass/new-analysis-uses-reddit-data-to-accurately-predict-popular-vote-margin-in-the-2016-election-14-3a9cb2f4cb5c).
